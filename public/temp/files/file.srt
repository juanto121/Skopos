1
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:04,201
a classical computer

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:04,681
performs

3
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,682
operations using classical

4
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:08,882
bits, whichs can be either zero or one

5
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:09,681
now in contrast

6
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:11,641
a quantum computer

7
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:12,402
uses quantum bits, or

8
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:15,002
qubits

9
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:15,761
and they can be both zero and one

10
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:18,761
at the same time
