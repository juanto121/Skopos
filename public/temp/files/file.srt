00:00:02,242 --> 00:00:02,902
Ahhh, the sound

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:03,902
of shaking

3
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:05,262
animal intestins

4
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:08,002
I mean strings

5
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:10,802
which are traditionally made out of cat gut

6
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,282
when a string vibrates

7
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:12,002
it does so with the ends

8
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:13,442
fixed to the instrument

9
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:14,382
this means that it can only vibrate

10
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:16,762
In certain ways

11
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:17,282
sine waves

12
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:20,282
like a jump rope
