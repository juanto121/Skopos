Hi

2
00:00:09,996 --> 00:00:12,434
im lea

3
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:14,344
if youve ever heard about me

4
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:15,624
before its probably due to

5
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:16,701
one of my open source projects

6
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:18,245
you might have seen some of them

7
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:19,830
the rest are on github

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,487
Im an invited expert in the csworking group

9
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:24,361
that just means that I gather mainly

10
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,945
with some other people

11
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:27,185
four times a year and we spend

12
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:28,160
increasing amounts of time

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,167
discussing

14
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:36,490
edge cases of decreasing likelihood

15
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,668
as my sort of day to day job

16
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:39,191
I've been exploring

17
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:42,077
academia for the

18
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:42,971
past year, I've been doing research

19
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:45,043
at MIT

20
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:46,039
and I recently published a book

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,039
with O'relly
